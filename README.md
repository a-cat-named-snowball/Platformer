This is an old platformer I made in 2014. The code is a bit embarassing, and some pretty terrible game design choices were made.

I'm going to work on improving it until it's actually a good game.

## TODO
- [ ] Split code into more than one file
- [ ] Improve collision detection
- [ ] Make a level editor
- [ ] Reduce volume for sfx
- [ ] Better graphics
- [x] Make the game take up the entire page
- [x] Fix framerate, use requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval
