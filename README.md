This is an old platformer I made in 2014. The code is a bit embarassing, and some pretty terrible game design choices were made.

I'm going to work on improving it until it's actually a good game.

## TODO
- Fix framerate, use requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval
- Split code into more than one file
- Improve collision detection
- Make a level editor
- Reduce volume for sfx
- Better graphics
